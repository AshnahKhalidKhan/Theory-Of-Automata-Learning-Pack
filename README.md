# A passion project, to say the least ^_^

Developing a learner pack for one of the courses students at my university find hardest to learn. My aim is to include lessons, practice questions, exercises and program codes to assist in learning each of the fundamental concepts taught in Theory of automata and Theory of Computation courses. Hopefully, this will make a difference in at least one student's life!
