\begin{enumerate}
    % 1. Design of Turing Machine single tape. 
    \item
    \textbf{\{Design of Turing Machine single tape\}}
    \\Design a Turing machine that accepts the language \(L = \set{ bb\Sigma^* \mid \Sigma = \set{a, b}}\). Assume that the transition function \( \delta \) for the TM is defined as \( \delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \set{L,R}\).

    % 2. Design of Multitape TM
    \item
    \textbf{\{Design of Multitape TM\}}

    % 3. Proof on equivalence of various models of TM
    \item
    \textbf{\{Proof on equivalence of various models of TM\}}
    \\Consider a Turing machine that, on any particular move, can either change the tape symbol or move the read-write head, but not both.
    \\(a) Give a formal definition of such a machine.
    \\(b) Show that the class of such machines is equivalent to the class of standard Turing machines.

    % 4. Some decidable languages and their proofs
    \item
    \textbf{\{Some decidable languages and their proofs\}}
    \\(a) Let \(A = \set{\langle R, S\rangle \mid \text{R and S are regular expressions and }L(R) \subseteq L(S)}\). Show that A is decidable.
    \\(b) Consider the problem of determining whether a DFA and a regular expression are equivalent. Express this problem as a language B and show that B is decidable.

    % 5. Examples of Undecidable languages
    \item
    \textbf{\{Examples of Undecidable languages\}}
    \\Let \(T = \set{\langle M\rangle \mid \text{M is a TM that accepts }w^R \text{ whenever it accepts w}}\). Show that T is undecidable.

    % 6. Design of enumerator as Turing recognizable language
    \item
    \textbf{\{Design of enumerator as Turing recognizable language, Examples of Undecidable languages, Reducibility of one problem to another\}}
    \\Let \(E^{TM} = \set{\langle M\rangle \mid \text{M is a TM and }L(M) = \emptyset}\). Show that \(\overline{E^{TM}}\), the complement of \(E^{TM}\), is:
    \\(a) Turing-recognizable, using an enumerator.
    \\(b) undecidable, using a reduction.

    % 7. One example of Turing Unrecognizable language
    \item
    \textbf{\{One example of Turing Unrecognizable language, Examples of Undecidable languages, Reducibility of one problem to another\}}
    a. INFINITETM = {hMi| M is a TM and L(M) is an infinite language}.
    \\Let \(E^{TM} = \set{\langle M\rangle \mid \text{M is a TM and }L(M) = \emptyset}\). Show that \(\overline{E^{TM}}\), the complement of \(E^{TM}\), is:
    \\(a) Turing-recognizable, using an enumerator.
    \\(b) undecidable, using a reduction.














    
    \item
        Let \(\Sigma = \set{a, b, c}\) and \(L = \set{ {a^i}{b^j}{c^k} \mid i, j, k \ge 0 \text{ and if } i = 1,  \text{ then } j = k}\). Show that \textit{L} is not regular using the pumping lemma.
        \\\textbf{Hint:} You must show both cases where when \(w = xyz\) that \(x = \lambda\) and where \(x\) is composed of some characters.
    % 2.
    \item 
        Let \(\Sigma = \set{0, 1, +, =}\) and \(ADD = \{ u+v=w \mid u, v, w \in \set{0, 1}^* \text{ and } u+v=w \text{ is a valid addition operation}\}\). Show that \textit{ADD} is not regular using the pumping lemma.
    % 3.
    \item
        For each of the following grammars, determine if they are ambiguous or unambiguous. If they are ambiguous, prove that by giving two parse trees for one same string.
